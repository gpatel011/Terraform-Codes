#Terraform Show command to Read State files
By default, in the working directory if we have terraform.tfstate file, when we provide the command terraform show it will read the state file automatically and display output.
# Terraform Show
terraform show
Observation: It should say "No State" because we will still didn't create any resources yet and no state file in current working directory

# Create Resources
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Terraform Show 
terraform show
Observation: It should display the state file
